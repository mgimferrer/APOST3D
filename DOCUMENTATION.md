# Documentation

## General information

The program has been written by using parts of the program APOST by I. Mayer and A. Hamza, Budapest, 2000-2003

The numerical integration utilizes the subroutines for Lebedev quadrature downloaded from CCL. The appropriate reference is: V.I. Lebedev, and D.N. Laikov "A quadrature formula for the sphere of the 131st algebraic order of accuracy" Doklady Mathematics, 59 477-481 1999

The program makes use of `Libxc` library when necessary, using the F90 interfaces provided by the authors (see http://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc)

We are extremely grateful for the possibility of using these routines!

## General structure

To successfully perform chemical bonding calculations using `APOST-3D`, the user requires the following two files: 

1. `name-input.fchk`: Gaussian-type formatted checkpoint file. It can be directly obtained from a Gaussian or Q-Chem run. Also, a Python function is provided in the utils folder (apost3d.py) to generate an fchk file from a PySCF run. Fchk files can also be generated by I/O converters such as iodata (https://github.com/theochem/iodata)

1. `name-input.inp`: Input file for `APOST-3D` requesting the type of calculation.


### Input structure

The input file requires a # METHOD section, which collects the keywords of the Atom in Molecule (AIM) method desired, the type of analysis to be performed and other options available to the user (e.g. generation of cube files). The section is structured as follows (the order of keywords is indifferent):

```
# METHOD
AIM         ## Keyword for the Atom in Molecule definition ##
ANALYSIS    ## Keyword for the analysis to be performed    ##
OTHERS      ## Keywords extra within METHOD section        ##
#
```

Then, each ANALYSIS and/or OTHERS keyword within the # METHOD section will require the inclusion of its section, namely # ANALYSIS OR # OTHERS. This leads to a general input such as:

```
# METHOD
AIM         ## Keyword for the Atom in Molecule definition ##
ANALYSIS    ## Keyword for the analysis to be performed    ##
OTHERS      ## Keyword/s extra within METHOD section       ##
#
# ANALYSIS
KEY1        ## List of keywords ##
KEY2
...
#
# OTHERS
KEY1        ## List of keywords ##
KEY2
...
#
```

The name will depend on the actual ANALYSIS and OTHERS keywords, see the detailed list of keywords together with their description in [here](#specific-keywords-and-description)

**Important**: Each section must be terminated with # at the end of the list of keywords as shown above. Keywords outside a section are ignored by `APOST-3D`

In this section, the keywords associated with the different # ANALYSIS sections are described. Not all ANALYSIS keywords in # METHOD require the definition of its section in the input file (see section [# METHOD](#section--method)) 

#### Oxidation states localized orbitals (OSLO)

**Important:** It is mandatory to include the TFVC keyword in # METHOD independently of the AIM desired to use for the OSLO calculation. Extracting OSLOs using alternative AIMs is controlled in this section (# OSLO)

#### Real-space molecular energy decomposition (# ENPART)

Currently, the code supports the following molecular energy decomposition for the following methods:

| CISD    | Decomposition of the CISD energy. Requires of the .dm1 and .dm2 files introduced in the # DM section (see [here](#higher-in-order-density-matrices-inputs--dm)) |
| | |

In the KS-DFT case, a general way to define the functional is possible. It requires entering the exchange and correlation (or exchange-correlation) functional ID as provided by the `Libxc` libraries. To do so, the following keywords are required:

| Keyword        | Description |
| -------        | ----------- |
| LIBRARY        | Decomposition of the molecular energy using the combination of exchange and correlation functional desired (if supported by `Libxc`). Mandatory to introduce the ID of the functional using the EXC_FUNCTIONAL, EX_FUNCTIONAL, and/or EC_FUNCTIONAL keywords. For the full list of functionals (and IDs), we guide the user to check `Libxc` libraries |
| EXC_FUNCTIONAL=val | Exchange-correlation functional integer ID for exchange-correlation-type functionals |
| EX_FUNCTIONAL=val  | Exchange functional integer ID for exchange-type functionals |
| EC_FUNCTIONAL=val  | Correlation functional integer ID for correlation-type functionals |
| | |

Extra options:

| Keyword       | Description |
| -------       | ----------- |
| CORRELATION   | For correlated wavefunctions, decomposition of the exchange and correlation energies, separately. By default, the code decomposes exchange-correlation altogether |
| THREBOD       | Bond order density (BODEN) threshold to skip evaluating the exact KS-DFT exchange-correlation between a pair of atoms. A multipolar approach is invoked for atom pairs with BODEN lower than the threshold. Expecting an integer number. A value lower than 0 sets the threshold to zero. Default value of 100 (threshold = THREBOD/10000.0d0) |
| EXACT         |  |
| ANALYTIC      |  |
| TWOELTOLER=val| Two-electron integration error threshold to activate the zero-error strategy. Default val=0.25d0 (in kcal/mol) |
| MOD-GRIDTWOEL | Modify the integration grid for the two-electron numerical integrations. Requires to define the # GRID section (see [here](#modification-of-the-two-electron-integration-grid--grid)) |
| | |

**Important additional information:** For Gaussian calculations, it is required an extra action to include the analytic energies from the .log file to the .fchk if desired to make use of the two-electron zero-error strategy. In particular:

* #p must be included in the input file from the Gaussian calculation 
* G09 -> $PROG/utils/get_energy mol.log >> mol.fchk
* G16 -> $PROG/utils/get_energy_g16 mol.log >> mol.fchk

For .fchk files obtained from pySCF using the apost3d.py extension, no action is required 

### Section: # OTHERS

In this section, the keywords associated with the different # OTHERS sections are described. Not all OTHERS keywords in # METHOD require the definition of its section in the input file (see section [# METHOD](#section--method))

| MAX_OCC=val | Maximal EFO occupation for generating the cube files. val is an integer in the range [0,1000] and the occupation is defined as val/1000)  |
| MIN_OCC=val | Minimal EFO occupation for generating the cube file. val is an integer in the range [0,1000] and the occupation is defined as val/1000)  |
| | |

| | |

#### Higher in order density matrices inputs (# DM)

This section requires first to add the keyword of the code where the .dm1 and .dm2 files were obtained. Then, their names ordered (.dm1 first) must be declared

| Keyword | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| pySCF | dm1 and dm2 files produced by apost3d.py utility  from a correlated PySCF run. |
| | |

#### Fragment definition (# FRAGMENTS)

This section requires declaring the number of fragments, and then for each fragment the number of atoms and the list of atoms constituting the fragment (atom numbers).

Illustrative example:

```
# FRAGMENTS
3         ## Number of fragments            ##
1         ## Number of atoms for fragment 1 ##
1         ## Atom list for fragment 1       ##
2         ## Number of atoms for fragment 2 ##
3 5       ## Atom list for fragment 2       ##
3         ## Number of atoms for fragment 3 ##
2 4 6     ## Atom list for fragment 3       ##
#
```

For the last fragment, the user can directly add -1 instead of the number of atoms and the list of atom numbers


## Input examples

In this section, example input files with the most commonly used keywords are provided for each type of calculation `APOST-3D` can perform. More flexibility and options are allowed, being the full list of keywords for each type of calculation collected [here](#specific-keywords-and-description)

The code allows the user to perform more than one type of calculation with the same input file
